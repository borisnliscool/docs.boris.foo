# Installation

Installing bnl-housing should be pretty easy. There's a couple of steps:

1. Download the release
   - Head over to the [releases section](https://github.com/borisnliscool/bnl-housing/releases) of the github project. Then locate the newest release and click [bnl-housing.zip](https://github.com/borisnliscool/bnl-housing/releases/latest/bnl-housing.zip)
   - It is important that you don't download the code as if you do that, you will need to compile the ui manually.
2. Installing in your server
   - Unzip the bnl-housing.zip in your resources folder and make sure it directly contains the files.
3. Ensuring database structure
   - Find the bnl-housing.sql file in the resource folder and run it in your database.

That's it, bnl-housing should now be installed but you're not done yet! Please read the [configuration guide](configuration) next.
