# Exports

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

In all examples of exports, we use a variable called Housing that is assigned to `exports["bnl-housing"]`. This way, we can use `Housing:method` to write cleaner code.
Make sure to add this to your code if you're blindly copying examples.

```lua
Housing = exports["bnl-housing"]
```

### All exports:

<DocCardList />
